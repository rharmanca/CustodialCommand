# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report

## Audit Timestamp

**Re-audited:** 2026-02-19T12:00:00.000Z  
**Previous Audit:** 2026-02-19T00:03:05.061Z  
**Audit Type:** Baseline Recovery Verification

## Scope

- Phase directories in milestone: `01-review-and-testing`, `02-recommendations`, `03-workflow-improvements`, `04-ui-polish`
- Source docs reviewed: `.planning/PROJECT.md`, `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
- Completed-work artifacts reviewed: phase `*-SUMMARY.md` files and `*-VERIFICATION.md` files

## Phase Verification Rollup (Recovered Baseline)

| Phase | Verification File | Status | Score | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01-review-and-testing | `01-VERIFICATION.md` | complete_with_gaps | 5/8 | Evidence backfilled from plan summaries; database verification confirmed |
| 02-recommendations | `02-VERIFICATION.md` | complete_with_gaps | 4/5 | Evidence backfilled; RESEARCH-VERIFICATION.md treated as context-only |
| 03-workflow-improvements | `03-VERIFICATION.md` | gaps_found | 20/23 | Requirements reconciliation complete; MOB-01 blocker preserved |
| 04-ui-polish | `04-VERIFICATION.md` | gaps_found | 2/7 | Verifier score in repo: `2/7` with multiple UX must-haves missing |

### Baseline Recovery Status

**Previous Blocker:** "Missing execution verification artifacts for phases 01-03"  
**Status:** ✅ **CLOSED** as of 2026-02-19

All three phase verification artifacts have been scaffolded and backfilled with conservative, traceable evidence:
- Phase 01: 5/8 requirements SATISFIED (1 PARTIAL, 1 BLOCKED, 1 NEEDS_RERUN)
- Phase 02: 4/5 core requirements SATISFIED (1 BLOCKED, 1 UNVERIFIED, 1 NEEDS_RERUN)
- Phase 03: 20/23 requirements SATISFIED (1 BLOCKED, 2 UNVERIFIED)

## Requirements Coverage (v2 set in REQUIREMENTS.md)

Method used:
- Mark `satisfied` when supported by verification evidence in recovered baseline
- Mark `blocked` for explicit blockers with evidence reference
- Mark `unverified` where runtime measurement evidence is missing

### Satisfied (20)

**Quick Capture (CAP): 7/7**
- `CAP-01` — Quick capture page exists, FAB entry point on dashboard
- `CAP-02` — Location preset buttons for minimal taps
- `CAP-03` — Continuous camera with PhotoPreviewStrip
- `CAP-04` — QuickNoteInput component with 200-char limit
- `CAP-05` — One-tap save with API integration
- `CAP-06` — Inspections save as pending_review status
- `CAP-07` — Success confirmation shown after save

**Photo-First Review (REV): 7/7**
- `REV-01` — Pending inspections list on desktop
- `REV-02` — Photos displayed prominently
- `REV-03` — Photos referenceable while completing form
- `REV-04` — Photos remain visible while scrolling
- `REV-05` — Full inspection completion with ratings
- `REV-06` — Separate capture and completion timestamps
- `REV-07` — Discard pending inspection capability

**Performance (PERF): 3/5**
- `PERF-02` — Camera stays active between shots
- `PERF-03` — Thumbnail generation service
- `PERF-05` — Progressive photo loading

**Mobile UX (MOB): 3/4**
- `MOB-02` — Visual distinction between capture and review
- `MOB-03` — Portrait orientation support
- `MOB-04` — Offline capability maintained

### Blocked (1)

- `MOB-01` (min 44px touch targets) — **BLOCKED**  
  Evidence: Location preset buttons use `min-h-[40px]` in `src/pages/quick-capture.tsx:356`  
  Source: Phase 04 verification carried forward to Phase 03

### Unverified (2)

- `PERF-01` (load time <300ms) — No runtime measurement evidence captured
- `PERF-04` (image loading <200ms) — No runtime measurement evidence captured

## Integration Checker Result

- Subagent: `gsd-integration-checker`
- Result: `gaps_found`
- Scores: integration `7/9`, flows `1/2`

### Critical Cross-Phase Integration Gaps (Unchanged)

1. **Pending badge contract mismatch:** `usePendingCount` consumes `pagination.totalCount`, backend returns `pagination.totalRecords`.
   - Evidence: `src/hooks/usePendingCount.ts:30`, `server/storage.ts:385`, `server/storage.ts:389`, `server/routes.ts:335`
   - Status: **OPEN** — Requires frontend/backend alignment

2. **No immediate pending-count refresh after quick capture save.**
   - Evidence: `src/pages/quick-capture.tsx:183`, `src/pages/quick-capture.tsx:194`, `src/hooks/usePendingInspections.ts:157`, `src/hooks/usePendingCount.ts:52`
   - Status: **OPEN** — Requires mutation event wiring

## Audit Conclusion

Milestone `v1.0` status after baseline recovery: **AUDITABLE WITH GAPS**

### Blocker Closure
✅ **Previous blocker RESOLVED:** "Missing execution verification artifacts for phases 01-03"  
All phase verification files now exist with conservative, traceable evidence.

### Remaining Gaps
1. **MOB-01:** Touch target violation requires Phase 04 fix
2. **PERF-01, PERF-04:** Runtime performance needs direct measurement
3. **Integration gaps:** Badge contract mismatch and refresh wiring (carry-forward)
4. **Phase 04:** 2/7 must-haves satisfied (separate tracking)

### Recommendation
Milestone is now **auditable** with transparent gap documentation. Remaining issues are:
- Functional gaps (Phase 04 completion)
- Performance measurement (runtime testing)
- Integration contract alignment (frontend/backend)
