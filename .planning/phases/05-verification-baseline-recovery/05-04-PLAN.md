must_haves:
  truths:
    - Verification artifacts for phases 01-03 are internally consistent and use the same status vocabulary
    - Milestone audit is re-run against recovered verification baseline
    - Milestone blocker related to missing execution verification artifacts is closed or explicitly reduced to remaining functional gaps
  artifacts:
    - path: .planning/phases/01-review-and-testing/01-VERIFICATION.md

<objective>
Run the final quality gate for recovered verification artifacts and re-audit milestone v1.0.

Purpose: Convert scaffolded/backfilled verification into auditable milestone evidence and clear the baseline blocker.
Output: Consistency-checked phase verification docs and updated milestone audit report.
