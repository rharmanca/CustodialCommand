- **End-to-End User Journey Tests** (`tests/e2e-user-journey.test.cjs`)
- **Performance Tests** (`tests/performance.test.cjs`)
- **Security Tests** (`tests/security.test.cjs`)
- **Mobile & PWA Tests** (`tests/mobile-pwa.test.cjs`)

### 2. **Master Test Runner** (`tests/run-all-tests.cjs`)
- Orchestrates all test suites
- Generates comprehensive reports
- Provides detailed analysis and recommendations

### 3. **Easy-to-Use Scripts**
- **Shell Script**: `./run-tests.sh` (executable)
- **NPM Scripts**: Added to `package.json`
- **Documentation**: Complete testing guide

### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- `COMPREHENSIVE_TESTING_GUIDE.md` - Complete testing documentation
- `TESTING_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## 🚀 How to Run Tests

### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:comprehensive

# Or use the shell script
./run-tests.sh
```

### Individual Test Suites
