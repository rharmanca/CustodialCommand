# üéØ Fix Toast Notification Display Issue - DIAGNOSIS ONLY

I have one specific issue to analyze in my working CA-Custodial-Command app: After submitting an inspection, the success notification appears but quickly disappears or goes to the bottom where I can't see it properly.

**Current behavior:** Success toast shows but isn't visible to users
**Expected behavior:** Success notification should be clearly visible and stay long enough to read

**IMPORTANT: DIAGNOSIS ONLY - DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES**

**Please investigate and identify the issue WITHOUT making changes:**

1. **Toast positioning analysis** - Examine the `<Toaster />` component in `App.tsx` and report its current configuration
   - What positioning is currently set?
   - Are there any CSS conflicts?

2. **Timing conflict analysis** - In `src/pages/custodial-inspection.tsx`, analyze the `handleSubmit` function:
   - What's the current toast duration setting?
   - How does the 3-second navigation delay interact with the toast?
   - Is there a timing conflict?

3. **Mobile viewport analysis** - Check for mobile-specific issues:
   - Is the toast responsive?
   - Are there viewport meta tag conflicts?
   - Any mobile-specific CSS that might hide toasts?

4. **Z-index and CSS analysis** - Examine potential style conflicts:
   - What z-index is set for toast components?
   - Are other components potentially covering the toast?
   - Any Tailwind classes that might interfere?

**CRITICAL: REPORT FINDINGS ONLY**
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** modify any files
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** change toast configurations  
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** update component code
- ‚ùå **DO NOT** install new packages
- ‚úÖ **DO** provide detailed analysis of what you find
- ‚úÖ **DO** explain the root cause
- ‚úÖ **DO** suggest what changes would fix it (but don't implement)

**Expected output:**
- Detailed report of current toast implementation
- Root cause identification
- Recommended changes (for me to implement manually)
- Risk assessment of any proposed changes

This is a production app that's currently working - I only want diagnosis and recommendations, not implementation.
