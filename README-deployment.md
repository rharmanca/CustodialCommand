# Deployment Guide for Shared Service Command

## ✅ Deployment Issues Fixed (July 29, 2025)

All deployment configuration issues have been successfully resolved:

### 🔧 Fixed Configuration Issues

1. **✅ Deployment Configuration**: Created `replit-deploy.json` with proper run, build, and install commands
2. **✅ Production Start Script**: Created `production-start.js` with proper static file serving
3. **✅ Build Process**: Verified existing build artifacts in `client/dist` and `server/public`
4. **✅ Port Configuration**: Server correctly binds to `0.0.0.0:PORT` for Replit Cloud Run
5. **✅ Static File Serving**: Configured to serve from the correct directory structure

### 📋 Deployment Configuration Files

- **`replit-deploy.json`**: Contains deployment commands for Replit
- **`production-start.js`**: Simple, reliable production server
- **Existing build assets**: Available in `client/dist` and `server/public`

### 🚀 Deployment Ready

The application is now properly configured for Replit Cloud Run deployment with:

- ✅ Working production server tested and verified
- ✅ Correct static file serving from `/server/public`
- ✅ Health check endpoint at `/api/health`
- ✅ SPA fallback routing for React Router
- ✅ Proper error handling middleware

### 📋 Deployment Configuration

The application now has the proper structure for Replit Cloud Run deployment:

- **Run Command**: `npm start` (starts production server)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (builds both client and server)
- **Install Command**: `npm install` (installs all dependencies)

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. Click the **Deploy** button in Replit
2. Replit will automatically use the build and run commands configured in package.json
3. Your application will be deployed to a `.replit.app` domain

The deployment should now work successfully without the errors you encountered before.

### 🔍 Technical Details

- Client builds to `client/dist` with Vite
- Server serves static files from `server/public` in production
- All API routes properly configured under `/api` prefix
- Database connectivity preserved for production deployment
- PWA functionality maintained for mobile installation

Your Shared Service Command application is deployment-ready!
