# Deployment Guide for Shared Service Command

## ✅ Deployment Issues Fixed (July 29, 2025)

All deployment configuration issues have been successfully resolved:

### 🔧 Fixed Configuration Issues

1. **✅ .replit File Configuration**: Deployment section properly configured for Cloud Run
2. **✅ Run Command**: Updated to use `node production-start.js` directly
3. **✅ Build Command**: Created `build-deploy.js` script for reliable builds
4. **✅ Production Server**: `production-start.js` tested and working correctly
5. **✅ Static File Serving**: Builds to and serves from `server/public` directory

### 📋 Deployment Configuration Files

- **`.replit`**: Contains deployment section with proper Cloud Run configuration
- **`replit-deploy.json`**: Updated with correct run and build commands
- **`build-deploy.js`**: Custom build script that properly compiles client assets
- **`production-start.js`**: Lightweight production server optimized for deployment

### 🚀 Deployment Commands

The deployment now uses these verified commands:

- **Install**: `npm install`
- **Build**: `node build-deploy.js` (builds client to server/public)
- **Run**: `node production-start.js` (serves from server/public on port 5000)

### ✅ Verification Complete

All deployment requirements are now satisfied:

- ✅ Proper .replit file with deployment section
- ✅ Valid run command configuration
- ✅ Working build command that generates production assets
- ✅ Production server tested and verified
- ✅ Health check endpoint at `/api/health`
- ✅ SPA fallback routing for React Router
- ✅ Static files properly served from server/publicroper error handling middleware

### 📋 Deployment Configuration

The application now has the proper structure for Replit Cloud Run deployment:

- **Run Command**: `npm start` (starts production server)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build` (builds both client and server)
- **Install Command**: `npm install` (installs all dependencies)

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. Click the **Deploy** button in Replit
2. Replit will automatically use the build and run commands configured in package.json
3. Your application will be deployed to a `.replit.app` domain

The deployment should now work successfully without the errors you encountered before.

### 🔍 Technical Details

- Client builds to `client/dist` with Vite
- Server serves static files from `server/public` in production
- All API routes properly configured under `/api` prefix
- Database connectivity preserved for production deployment
- PWA functionality maintained for mobile installation

Your Shared Service Command application is deployment-ready!
