**What's Missing:**
- Load testing scenarios (concurrent users)
- Image upload/processing speed benchmarks
- API response time metrics
- Database query performance under load
- Memory usage profiling

**Impact:** Medium risk
**Recommendation:** Add performance baseline testing

### 3. Edge Case Scenarios (Minor Gap)
**What's Missing:**
- Offline mode functionality testing
- Internationalization (i18n) coverage
- Permission handling edge cases
- Network failure recovery
- Corrupt data handling

**Impact:** Low-Medium risk
**Recommendation:** Include in next testing phase

## 🎯 Top 3 Immediate Actions (Per Copilot)

### Action 1: Security Validation ⭐⭐⭐
**Priority:** Critical
**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**What to Do:**
1. Test password complexity requirements
2. Verify authentication lockout mechanism
3. Validate input sanitization
4. Check session management

**Script Provided:**
```bash
# Security test script generated by Copilot
/tmp/mobile_security_test.sh
```

### Action 2: Image Upload Validation ⭐⭐⭐
**Priority:** Critical
**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**What to Do:**
1. Test file size limits (max 10MB)
2. Validate supported formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
3. Test special characters in filenames
4. Verify compression functionality

**Script Provided:**
```bash
# Image validation test script
/tmp/image_upload_validation.sh
```

### Action 3: Database Integrity Check ⭐⭐
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** 1-2 hours

**What to Do:**
1. Verify inspector_name column integrity
2. Check image_path tracking
3. Validate data consistency
4. Audit recent submissions

**SQL Queries Provided:**
```sql
-- Check inspector submissions
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records,
       COUNT(DISTINCT inspector_name) as unique_inspectors
FROM custodial_notes;

-- Verify image uploads
SELECT date, COUNT(*) as submissions,
       SUM(CASE WHEN array_length(images, 1) > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as with_images
FROM custodial_notes
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

## 🔧 Recommended Verification Commands

### Database Verification
```bash
# Verify Phase 6 schema changes
PGPASSWORD="npg_WwJEd5ILV7lq" psql \
  -h ep-aged-wind-ad9g7vhf-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech \
  -U neondb_owner -d neondb \
  -c "\d custodial_notes"

# Check recent submissions
PGPASSWORD="npg_WwJEd5ILV7lq" psql \
  -h ep-aged-wind-ad9g7vhf-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech \
  -U neondb_owner -d neondb \
  -c "SELECT id, inspector_name, school, array_length(images, 1) as image_count, created_at FROM custodial_notes ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"
```

### API Endpoint Testing
```bash
# Test custodial notes API
curl -s https://cacustodialcommand.up.railway.app/api/custodial-notes | jq '.[0:3]'

# Test with authentication
curl -X POST https://cacustodialcommand.up.railway.app/api/custodial-notes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "inspectorName": "Test Inspector",
    "school": "Test School",
    "date": "2025-11-02",
    "location": "Main Hall",
    "notes": "Test submission",
    "images": []
  }'
```

### Frontend Asset Verification
```bash
# Verify Phase 6 assets deployed
curl -I https://cacustodialcommand.up.railway.app/assets/index-CswGfcXg-v6.js

# Check for React Hook Form in bundle
curl -s https://cacustodialcommand.up.railway.app/assets/vendor-Dvwkxfce-v6.js | grep -o "react-hook-form" | head -1
```
