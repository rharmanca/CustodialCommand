# Shared Services Management Application

## Overview
This is a full-stack web application designed for managing custodial services operations. It provides tools for conducting single area and whole building inspections, reporting custodial concerns, and visualizing inspection data. The application aims to streamline custodial management with features like comprehensive rating criteria, auto-save functionality, and a mobile-optimized interface, all within a retro propaganda poster aesthetic.
